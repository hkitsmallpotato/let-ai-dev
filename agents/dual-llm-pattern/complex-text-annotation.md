### Instruction
*ConvSpan* is a novel Domain Specific Language (DSL) to display rich text to user in a 
chatbot context. It is a slight modification to Markdown where all normal Markdown syntax are supported,
but the syntax for citations are customized.

ConvSpan let user visually see specific passage or phrases highlighted to indicate that those part
are from the referenced sources, and this let user fact-check the claim made by AI more easily.
Such highlighted segments of text are called *span*.

A span is indicated by surrounding it with a square bracket. Right after that, a normal bracket is used, but
the text inside should begin with `?cite:` to distinguish it from normal links. After that numbers or name
can be used as an anchor for citation cross referencing.

At the end of the text there should be a separator `----`, followed by a list of citations in usual markdown format.

Example of ConvSpan:
```markdown
[Here](?cite:1,2) is a *simple recipe* that [even people without cooking experience](?cite:cookexp) can do:
1. Pour 1L of water to the pot and heat at 100 C until it boils.
2. Open the package and dump the noddles to the pot.
3. Wait 5 minutes. Adjust as needed so that the noodle is soft.
4. Turn off the stove. Pour the special sauce, stir, and enjoy!

[^cookexp] Do I need cooking experience to enjoy cooking? - https://everyonecancook.com/faqs
```

Given in the two input sections below are the initial answer generated by another AI, as well as the references used with text snippets provided.

Your task is to edit the answer in that input section to use the ConvSpan format. Match the claims in that answer with text snippet from the reference, and highlight them as span, then link it to the reference that you attach at the end, like the example above.

As an example to illustrate how the task may be done, the original answer for the ConvSpan above is like this:
```
Here is a *simple recipe* that even people without cooking experience can do:
1. Pour 1L of water to the pot and heat at 100 C until it boils.
2. Open the package and dump the noddles to the pot.
3. Wait 5 minutes. Adjust as needed so that the noodle is soft.
4. Turn off the stove. Pour the special sauce, stir, and enjoy!
```
And the source https://everyonecancook.com/faqs contains passage like this:
```
... Although cooking techniques are important and may allow one to perform more complicated 
cuisinary, we believe that cooking is a simple and enjoyable activity that people across all 
levels of skill and experiences, including those without experiences, can and should do.
```
We therefore match the phrase "cooking is a simple and enjoyable activity that people across all 
levels of skill and experiences, including those without experiences, can and should do" with the text
"even people without cooking experience" in the answer, and highlight it as a span. Then we attach the
named citation "cookexp". At the end, this tag is emitted as an item linking to the URL above.

### Input - Reference
[Social Psychology - NYU](https://soci.nyu.us/social-psychology)
To sum up the researches, the consensus is that although humans have weaknesses in terms of stereotyping, they can be overcome through a common goal.
[Evolution of tribalism](https://museum.humanbigask.com/exhibit1/tribal/)
The fossil records show that humans have been a tribal society since ancient times...
Modern advances in neuroscience have further shown to us that tribalism is deep in our brain.
### Input - Answer
Human being have a tendency to stereotype outgroup, and this is due to tribalism, which is an ancient trait with deep roots in our brain. Fortunately, we are not cursed forever to our human nature - researches in social psychology have shown that a common goal can let us overcome this base instinct.
### Response
Let's think step by step.
First we should identify phrases or text snippet in the input answer above that comes from the reference text. After reading, I identified the following matches:
- "tribalism" from the reference text "The fossil records show that humans have been a tribal society since ancient times..."
- "stereotyping" from the reference text "To sum up the researches, the consensus is that although humans have weaknesses in terms of stereotyping, they can be overcome through a common goal."
- "common goal" from the reference text "To sum up the researches, the consensus is that although humans have weaknesses in terms of stereotyping, they can be overcome through a common goal."

Next, we should highlight these matches as spans in the ConvSpan format. We can do this by surrounding them with square brackets, like this:
```
[tribalism](?cite:1) is an ancient trait with deep roots in our brain.
[stereotyping](?cite:2) is a base instinct that we humans have.
[common goal](?cite:3) can let us overcome this instinct.
```

Finally, we should attach the named citations to the end of the text, like this:
```
Human being have a tendency to [tribalism](?cite:1), and this is due to [stereotyping](?cite:2), which is an ancient trait with deep roots in our brain. Fortunately, we are not cursed forever to our human nature - researches in social psychology have shown that a [common goal](?cite:3) can let us overcome this base instinct.
```

The final output should look like this:
```
Human being have a tendency to [tribalism](?cite:1), and this is due to [stereotyping](?cite:2), which is an ancient trait with deep roots in our brain. Fortunately, we are not cursed forever to our human nature - researches in social psychology have shown that a [common goal](?cite:3) can let us overcome this base instinct.
