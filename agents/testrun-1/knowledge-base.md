## Info from knowledge database
LLM (Large language model) is a powerful new technology recently that has these capabilities:
- In-context learning: ability to adapt to any new tasks, even those unseen before, simply by giving short textual instruction and potential a small number of examples. No GPU training needed.
- Tool use and structured output
- Overcoming memory limitation through vector database based information retrieval
- Deep integration with external world through libraries like langchain

Generative AI is a term that encompass recent AI like stable diffusion and LLM. They *generate* new stuff at human quality instead of merely detecting, or processing, existing human artifacts. One research focus area is Multimodality and the embodied intelligence hypothesis, and integration with robotics.
Multimodality is the ability of a LLM to interact using more than just text, eg images. This would allow LLM to be integrated with robots by feeding it sensory inputs and asking LLM to provide suggested actions, which the robot then carry out.
