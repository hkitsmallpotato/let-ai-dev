# Appendix: Human simulated agent output

## System output
You performed web search in "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "neural network", "deep learning" last round. After browsing through the top hits and having another assistent AI summarize it, here's a report:
The rate of progress in AI is explosive in the last 6 months, due to the stable diffusion (a model to generate image from text prompt) revolution first, and then later, ChatGPT (a model in the Large Language Model/LLM family), and a long list of rapid developments in an extremely short time span. Both of them are under an emerging trend known as "generative AI". Whereas previous neural network based AI are about detection, and performing narrow-domain tasks, these new AI give promise for the ability to generates new artifacts at a near human level, and is getting somewhat close to the idea of general intelligence. There have however been concerned expressed about the potential impact of misuse, such as misinformation, tyranny, job loss, and existential risk.
