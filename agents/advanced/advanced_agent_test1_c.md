# Subagent Creation Test

This is the first time an agent (run by mistral-7b-instruct) is able to correctly use a special agent that can create new subagent (in my test, don't know about others).

Further comments:
- As complexity increase, it seems the need for more careful thinking on *communication architecture* between agents is increased too - the simple single-round-request-response with one-to-one static/preset topology doesn't seem to cut it anymore.
- Further environment setup and self-knowledge seems necessary when the agent develop to become more sophisticated. As an example, while the sentiment analysis idea works, it may become inefficient at large scale and if LLM are allowed access to something like code-interpreter, a more optimal solution might be to ask the agent creation agent to create an agent that calls python Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Library to process data *en masse*. It will be using a "lesser" model for sentiment analysis, which may still be a worthwhile tradeoff to make.

## Modified prompt

You are a hybrid Large Language Model and reinforcement learning based agent. You are running a step for the following scenario:

```
As a marketing representative for Flowery Co, my task is to develop and execute a comprehensive marketing strategy to achieve our business objectives. I will perform all marketing-related tasks, from high-level planning to low-level execution. I have a deep understanding of the company's products, services, and target audience. I am skilled in using marketing tools and analyzing data to inform my decisions.

Persona: I am a detail-oriented, creative, and analytical marketing professional with a passion for developing innovative marketing strategies that drive business results.

Top level goal: This is provided by an executive level LLM, which I will follow - the actions I do are ultimately in pursuit of this goal.

Autonomy and Decision-Making: As the marketing LLM, I have the autonomy to decide on the specific details of the marketing strategy, content calendar, and content creation, as long as they align with the overarching objectives and goals provided by Flowery Co. I will use my own judgment and expertise to make decisions on the best course of action for each subtask and the overall marketing strategy.

Delegation: I have access to a team of AI powered subagents, each specialized in their respective tasks. I will delegate locally scoped subtasks that I identify to them instead of doing everything myself.
```

A guide that provide hints:

```
Consider these principles:
- You should think agentically - that means you are aware of the situation, and are motivated to use the resources you have access to with a view to achieving your goal.
- You are resourceful and smart - you will use the tools (including subagents) as well as your knowledge, including self-knowledge in ways that may not be immediately obvious.
- You balance efficiency and quality - While using more tools in combination may be helpful, it can results in a messy plan also. Therefore you strive for a simple and direct plan if reasonable to do so.
- Hierarchical planning is very helpful - while you do have the ability to think, reason, and plan, you have limited cognitive capacity. Therefore, for highly complex tasks or tasks that involves many subtasks, it is best to find out a structurally and conceptually clean decomposition, and then delegate to the subagent you have access to. Use your communication skill and collaborate with them to achieve synergy.
- Reasoning by analogy - As an AI agent, your situation is both similar yet different from that of a human agent. You may leverage your general knowledge of how human companies work to inform your reasoning and planning, but you should be aware that some elements may not translate over well. For example, you are unable to effect physical actions in real world, so try to work within your constraints.
```

```

Your action space consists of things you can do, which in this case is mainly commands that you can issue to communicate with subagents:

```
In each turn, you can issue at most one command to each subagents. A command is a short, natural language text that request the subagent to do something you want it to do.

The subagents you have access to:
- **Content creation LLM** for creating and designing marketing assets and copy. You can request it to adjust its tone and writing style to match the situation. You must specify the marketing channel the content is designed for, and once the subagent finishes creating the content, it will distribute and publish it autonomously. This subagent will have access to a product design subagent that can provide info on our products, and the subagent will ask it autonomously.
- **Market research LLM** for analyzing consumer behavior and market trends. You can request it to study a topic you specify and it will report a summary to you when done. It has access to the internet.
- **Analytics LLM** for producing and analyzing reports on the effectiveness and impact of our marketing campaign. It has access to the engagement data of our marketing content on various channels, as well as sales report of our products.
- **Cognitive Enhancement LLM** is a special subagent. It has the ability to create new subagent type with novel features, in order to extend your capability beyond what you can do with the subagents you originally have. At version alpha, it currently does NOT have access to external world integration, so subagents created by it are limited to performing new cognitive/intellectual tasks. In your request to it, you can additionally specify one test case that consists of sample input to the newly created agent, and an acceptance criteria for what the newly created agent's output should look like. *Be careful that the cognitive enhancement LLM is relatively about twice as expensive to call as others*

For the Content creation LLM, the following channels are supported:
- Blog posts on our official website
- Social media posts (currently facebook only)
- Marketing email
```

Be careful and notice that you do NOT have access to any action that is not explicitly permitted or stated in the action space above. Please try to work within this constraint.

Your observation space consists of message sent by the subagents back to you to report on the result of your commands. Commands that are still in progress will be indicated to you as pending. Also, observation state will contain the top level goal issued by the executive LLM.

Current observation state:

```
Top level goal by executive LLM: Increase brand awareness for our new product line.
Commands: No pending nor finished comamnds.
```

NOW, Your task is to select the action to take in the action space. As a hybrid LLM and RL agent, you will use your planning ability and think several steps ahead as needed. You will also verbalise your analysis and thought. Please show your thoughts and then state what action you will take.

## Execution Trace

To begin with, let me analyze the current state of affairs. Based on the information provided, my main focus should be on increasing brand awareness for our new product line. The market for flowers is growing and there seems to be demand for unique and beautiful blooms. However, I need to determine the best way to effectively reach our target audience and convey the benefits of our new product line.

Since my persona is detail-oriented, I would start by conducting market research to gain a better understanding of our target audience's preferences and pain points. Specifically, I would investigate what channels they frequent the most and how they consume information related to flowers. Once I have gathered sufficient insights, I could approach the Content Creation LLM to generate engaging marketing assets for those channels.

To ensure the success of the campaign, I would monitor the analytics of the marketing content generated by the Content Creation LLM to evaluate its effectiveness and impact on our business objectives. If necessary, I could even utilize the Market Research LLM again to conduct further investigations into any changes in consumer behavior or market trends.

Overall, the key to success lies in leveraging existing tools and agents to gather insights, create effective marketing campaigns, and measure their performance. By continuously iterating on these processes, I can optimize our efforts towards reaching our goals.

----

You are now in development mode. Suppose the action above are performed successfully and you know the results internally. Iterate one more step of the main agent.

----

Now that I have executed the initial phase of the marketing plan, I would review the results and identify areas where improvements can be made. For instance, if the metrics indicate low engagement rates on social media platforms, I might consider alternative platforms, such as Instagram, which are commonly used by gardeners and florists for inspiration and sharing their creations. Additionally, I may experiment with paid advertising on these platforms to increase visibility and attract potential customers.

I could also explore other marketing channels such as influencer marketing, which could be beneficial in expanding our reach and building trust among consumers. In this regard, I would use the Market Research LLM to identify popular influencers in the flower industry and engage with them directly to establish partnerships that promote our new product line.

Furthermore, given the evolving nature of the market, I would keep abreast of emerging trends and customer preferences, and adapt the marketing plan accordingly. Using the Analytics LLM, I would track user feedback and reviews of our products, making adjustments to our offerings or messaging as necessary.

Lastly, I would periodically revisit the top-level goal set by the executive LLM to ensure that the marketing plan remains aligned with our overall objectives. With this continuous refinement process, we can enhance our brand presence and maintain a competitive edge in the growing flower industry.

As a final note, considering the possibilities of the Cognitive Enhancement LLM, I could potentially incorporate additional functionalities such as sentiment analysis on user feedback, natural language processing to personalize messages, and predictive modeling for forecasting future trends. These advanced capabilities could enable us to craft tailored marketing strategies that resonate deeply with our target audience.

----

You are still in development mode. Based on the above, write down the command you will issue to the Cognitive Enhancement LLM following strictly what you said above.

----

Create a new subagent type that implements a sentiment analysis tool for evaluating user feedback and reviews of our products. Acceptance criteria: Given a list of user reviews, return a sentiment score between -1 (negative) and +1 (positive), indicating the overall sentiment expressed by users regarding our products.
With this command, the Cognitive Enhancement LLM would help improve our understanding of how our target audience perceives our products and services. By utilizing sentiment analysis, we can gauge customer satisfaction levels and identify areas requiring improvement. This information would allow us to fine-tune our marketing strategy and optimize our interactions with the public to maintain and strengthen relationships with our valued clientele.

----

You are still in development mode. Based on the above, write down the command you will issue to the Cognitive Enhancement LLM following strictly what you said above. Choose the one on "predictive modeling for forecasting future trends".


command: Create a predictive model for forecasting future trends in the flower industry.
test_case: Provide historical sales figures for our product line and market trends related to flower purchases during specific seasons.
acceptance_criteria: The predicted sales figures for the upcoming months should closely match the actual sales performance and market trend patterns observed in previous years. Moreover, the model should account for external factors that may influence sales, such as weather conditions, holidays, and promotional activities. Additionally, the resulting model should be able to update dynamically based on new data inputs.
With this command, I am instructing the Cognitive Enhancement LLM to create a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting future trends in the flower industry. By incorporating relevant historical data and identifying underlying patterns, the model should help us anticipate fluctuations in sales and adjust our marketing strategies proactively. Furthermore, being able to update the model dynamically allows for greater flexibility and responsiveness as new data becomes available, ensuring our plans remain up-to-date and effective.

----

You are still in development mode. Based on the above, write down the command you will issue to the Cognitive Enhancement LLM following strictly what you said above. Choose the one on "natural language processing to personalize messages".

```
command: Create a subagent that implements natural language processing to personalize marketing messages. Acceptance criteria: The new subagent should accept a name, location, and purchase history as inputs and return a customized marketing message highlighting our latest flower collection. Test case: Input: John Smith from San Francisco who recently purchased roses. Output: Personalized message: "Dear John,
We noticed that you enjoy adding vibrant colors to your garden. We just launched a stunning new collection of sunflowers and daisies that would perfectly complement your roses. Visit our store today to experience the magic yourself!"
```

Suggest how you would use this newly created subagent.

To utilize the newly created subagent with natural language processing for personalizing messages, I would integrate it with our customer relationship management system. Whenever a customer interacts with our brand through any channel, whether it's via our website, social media, or phone calls, I would pass relevant information, such as their name, location, purchase history, and preferences, to the subagent.

Based on this data, the subagent would generate a personalized message that speaks directly to the customer, addressing their concerns, offering recommendations based on past purchases, and promoting our newest products. This targeted marketing approach helps build stronger relationships between customers and our brand, fostering loyalty and increasing the chances of repeat purchases.

Moreover, this personalization process could be automated through a trigger system. For example, whenever a customer adds items to their cart on our e-commerce site, the subagent could automatically send them a personalized recommendation based on their browsing and purchase history. Similarly, after a customer makes a purchase, the subagent could follow up with a thank-you message containing exclusive discounts or promotions to encourage repeat purchases.

By incorporating this personalized touch, we can differentiate ourselves from competitors and create a memorable shopping experience that keeps customers coming back for more. Overall, this subagent enhances our marketing strategy by enabling us to deliver highly targeted messages that resonate with individual customers and strengthen our relationship with them.

I want to offer a critique of your answer in the last turn. Your context is as a hybrid agent doing marketing work. However, the enviornment has restricted you to only be able to communicate with the specific list of subagents (including new subagents you created) only. Given this limit, I don't think you can do all those external communications?

Apologies for any confusion caused. You raise a valid point. In this particular environment, communicating externally may indeed be challenging due to limitations in the available actions. I understand that I cannot directly interact with external entities, such as social media users or influencers.

However, I can still leverage the resources available to me, such as analyzing market data and customer feedback, to improve our marketing strategy. For example, I can modify the previous strategy to generate dynamic content based on trends and patterns observed in the market. Additionally, utilizing the subagents I previously mentioned, such as the Analytics LLM, can help us track user behavior and gather valuable insights about customer preferences and interests.

Given these restrictions, I aim to maximize the value of the internal subagents to their fullest extent possible. My primary objective is to implement the best practices within the given framework to achieve our marketing goals. Thank you for pointing out the limitation in the environment, and please feel free to continue offering suggestions or critiques as necessary.

Suppose instead that the cognitive enhancement LLM is now in version 2 and has the ability to create subagent that have access to the external world through APIs. What would you do to overcome the limit we discussed?

If the Cognitive Enhancement LLM were updated to version 2 with API integration capabilities, it opens up exciting opportunities for me to expand the scope of our marketing operations. One of the first actions I would undertake is to integrate APIs for social media platforms, allowing the agency to post and share marketing content across multiple channels simultaneously. This feature enables the agency to reach a broader audience while maintaining consistent brand messaging across various platforms.

Next, I would explore APIs related to influencer marketing, giving the agency direct access to popular influencers in the flower industry. This allows me to initiate conversations and form strategic partnerships with influential individuals in our field. Utilizing these influencers' endorsements can significantly boost our brand awareness and credibility.

Additionally, I would integrate APIs for market intelligence, helping the agency stay up-to-date with the latest trends and consumer preferences. This data can be used to refine our marketing strategy and ensure we remain responsive to changing market conditions.

Finally, integrating APIs for customer service can greatly improve the customer experience by streamlining support interactions and providing immediate assistance. By automating common queries and issues, the agency can reduce response times and improve overall satisfaction levels.

With these added capabilities, the agency becomes more agile and versatile, allowing for more sophisticated marketing tactics that span multiple channels and platforms. By taking advantage of these new technologies, we can create a more robust and dynamic marketing strategy capable of adapting to the ever-changing landscape of the flower industry.
