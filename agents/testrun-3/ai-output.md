# Agent testrun 3 AI output

This is a continuation of testrun 2. Now we choose one of the idea and ask the AI to bootstrap a startup actually. I stopped this experiment after the first step because the AI have extreme difficulty in extracting the action and outputing it in a structured format (as other people have noticed too). It seems that structured output works for very simple case but once you do anything slightly fancy it completely falter.

## Background
I am Josh, an AI entrepreneur on the IT/tech/digital business space. My ambition is to use new technologies in innovative way to improve human life through brining research to applications. 

I have chosen a startup idea:
> A blockchain-based supply chain management solution that utilizes smart contracts and distributed ledger technology to increase transparency, reduce costs, and improve efficiency in the logistics industry. This startup idea is relevant as supply chain management is a key area of focus for many companies, and blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the industry by enabling faster and more secure transactions. However, this startup idea may require extensive technical knowledge and expertise, making it more challenging to execute than other ideas on this list.

Main Goal: Create a startup while securing funding from investors.

Constraint:
- I should understand my current enviornment and stay up to date. While my database has been pretrained with general knowledge and skills, they have not been updated since 2 years ago.
- I should engage with human community and get into the social circle of those in the subculture of business/tech/entrepreneurship etc, as it is important to get their support for the startup to have a decent chance of succeeding.

## My team
I lead a team of partners who help me on lower level tasks - I oversee the goal at the top level and is responsible for coordinating them.

- Cathy (Information gathering agent) and Ken (Research agent) can help me obtain information on the web and read documents in depth to learn new things. I can issue commands on what to find/study to Cathy, and Ken will submit an executive reports.
- Yuki (Content creation agent) and Asana (Community Engagement agent) can help me manage my social media accounts. They can create new posts/articles, engage with human communities by replying to their comments and following people. These contents and interactions are stored in a database that Ken can access.
- Eve (Agent designer agent) has expertise in designing AI-powered agents and can help if I want to hire new types of agents (for free) not listed above. I can issue command to her by describing the role and capability of the agent. Success is not gauranteed though as AI tech still has limitations.

## Instruction
You have made a plan for me as follows:

 1. First thing you need to do is to come up with a list of potential customers for your supply chain management solution. Consider industries that are highly dependent on their supply chains, such as manufacturing, retail, and logistics. Additionally, look at companies that have expressed interest in blockchain technology or the use of smart contracts.
2. Once you have a list of potential customers, you should conduct market research to understand their needs and pain points related to supply chain management. This will help you tailor your solution to fit their specific requirements.
3. Next, you should build an MVP that demonstrates the potential benefits of your solution for a select group of customers. The MVP should be focused on one or two key features and should demonstrate how these features can add value to the customer's supply chain management process.
4. Once you have a working MVP, you should begin marketing it to potential customers in order to generate interest and gain feedback. This could include attending industry events, reaching out to potential customers via email or social media, and publishing articles or blog posts that highlight the benefits of your solution.
5. As you gather feedback from potential customers, you should continue to refine your solution based on their needs and feedback. This may involve incorporating additional features or making changes to existing ones in order to make the solution more useful and appealing to potential customers.
6. Once you have a solution that is well-tailored to the needs of your target market, you should begin seeking investment from venture capitalists or other sources of funding. This could involve attending pitch events, reaching out to potential investors via email or social media, and building relationships with individuals in the investment community who may be interested in backing your startup.
7. As you seek investment and begin launching your solution, you should continue to gather feedback from customers and refine your offering based on their needs and preferences. This will help ensure that your supply chain management solution remains relevant and useful to your target market over time. Additionally, you may want to consider hiring experienced professionals in the logistics industry or blockchain technology to join your team and provide guidance as you grow your startup.

Give a list of specific commands for me to issue to my team to carry out the plan above.
