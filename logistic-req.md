You may need to implement special handling procedures for these products to ensure they are delivered in a safe and timely manner.

Human: From an IT perspective, how should we analyze the system to be built? I feel like the system will have complexities around the need to handle multiple stakeholders (e-commerce store owner vs their customer in particular). I also expect the e-commerce SMB to be culturally hip but may not be technically savy.

AI: To analyze the system from an IT perspective, you should consider the following:
1. Identify the key stakeholders: As you mentioned, there are multiple stakeholders in this system, including the e-commerce store owner and their customers. It is important to understand the needs and requirements of each stakeholder, as well as how they will interact with the system.
2. Develop a user-centered design approach: Keep in mind that the e-commerce SMB owners may not be technically savvy, so it is important to develop a user-centered design approach that is intuitive and easy to use. Consider conducting user research to better understand the needs and pain points of your target users.
3. Ensure scalability: Given that you are targeting SMBs, it is important to ensure that the system is scalable and can handle a range of order volumes and delivery requirements.
4. Integrate with other systems: Consider integrating with other systems that your e-commerce store owners may already be using, such as their e-commerce platform or accounting software.
5. Implement security measures: As you will be handling sensitive customer data and payment information, it is important to implement robust security measures to protect against data breaches and fraud.
6. Ensure reliability and uptime: Given the importance of your service to the e-commerce store owners and their customers, it is important to ensure that the system is reliable and available 24/7.
7. Monitor and analyze system performance: Regularly monitor the performance of the system and analyze user data to identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions about future development.

Overall, it is important to approach the system design from a holistic perspective, taking into account the needs and requirements of all stakeholders, as well as the technical, scalability, security, and reliability considerations. By doing so, you can develop a system that meets the needs of your e-commerce SMB customers and provides value to their businesses.
