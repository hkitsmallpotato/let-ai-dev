# Vicuna-13b v1.1 runs on a Food ordering and delivery platform (part 5)

Note: the messed up code at the end is part of my fault. Still inculuded here for completeness's sake and to show that the AI is aware of the static webpage hosting part (for the SPA frontend) too and not just blindly focusing on the backend.

## Initial answer

Based on the requirements and architecture proposed for the FoodFast project, here are some suggestions for cloud resources and configurations:
1. Public vs private vs hybrid vs multi cloud: For the FoodFast project, it is recommended to use a public cloud such as AWS or Azure. This is because public clouds offer scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness, which are important for a food delivery platform that requires fast delivery times and high volume of orders. Public clouds also provide easy integration with third-party services such as payment gateways and delivery tracking systems.
2. Kubernetes vs VM vs PaaS: For the FoodFast project, it is recommended to use a Kubernetes cluster on the chosen public cloud provider. Kubernetes provides a highly scalable and flexible platform for deploying and managing microservices, which is essential for a food delivery platform that requires fast delivery times and high volume of orders. Using Kubernetes also allows for easy integration with other cloud services such as databases and storage systems.
3. Assign components to corresponding cloud resources and specify any supporting cloud resources needed:
* Presentation Layer: The frontend of the platform can be implemented as a web application, and can be hosted on a web server running on the same cloud infrastructure as the Kubernetes cluster.
* Application Layer: The microservices that make up the application layer can be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes cluster can also include supporting services such as load balancers and DNS servers.
* Data Layer: The data layer can be implemented using a managed database service such as Amazon RDS or Azure SQL Database. These databases can be deployed to the same cloud infrastructure as the Kubernetes cluster.
4. High-level configuration:
* For the Kubernetes cluster, a virtual network can be configured to provide network isolation and security for the microservices.
* For the data layer, the database management system can be configured to provide backup and disaster recovery options.
Overall, the FoodFast project can be hosted on a public cloud infrastructure such as AWS or Azure, with a Kubernetes cluster running on the public cloud providing the necessary scalability and flexibility for the platform's microservices. The presentation and application layers can be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster, while the data layer can be implemented using a managed database service. A virtual network can be configured for the Kubernetes cluster to provide network isolation and security, while the database management system can be configured for backup and disaster recovery options.

## Continuation

- Suppose AWS is chosen. Show me a terraform script to perform initial setup of the cloud resources.
- Program sources are hosted on github. Propose CI/CD pipeline to deploy our system.

## Low level coding

Here is an example Terraform script for initial setup of AWS cloud resources for the FoodFast project:
```TCL
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Create a virtual private cloud (VPC)
resource "aws_vpc" "foodfast_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

# Create a subnet within the VPC
resource "aws_subnet" "foodfast_subnet" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.foodfast_vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

# Create an internet gateway
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "foodfast_gateway" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.foodfast_vpc.id
}

# Attach the internet gateway to the VPC
resource "aws_vpc_attachment" "foodfast_attachment" {
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.foodfast_vpc.id
  internet_gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.foodfast_gateway.id
}

# Create a security group for the Kubernetes cluster
resource "aws_security_group" "foodfast_k8s_sg" {
  name_prefix = "foodfast-k8s-sg"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.foodfast_vpc.id
}

# Add a rule to the security group to allow traffic on port 9090 for the Kubernetes cluster
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "foodfast_k8s_sg_rule" {
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.foodfast_k8s_sg.id
  type              = "ingress"
  from_port         = 9090
  to_port           = 9090
  protocol          = "tcp"
  cidr_blocks       = "0.0.0.0/0"
}

# Create a Kubernetes cluster
resource "aws_eks_cluster" "foodfast_cluster" {
  name                = "foodfast-cluster"
  node_group_configs = [
    {
      name       = "foodfast-ng1"
      instance_type = "m5.large"
      cluster_size = 3
      config {
        ebs_config {
          ebs_volume_size = 30
        }
        k8s_version = "1.19"
      }
      security_group_ids = [
        aws_security_group.foodfast_k8s_sg.id
      ]
    }
  ]
}

# Create a Kubernetes namespace
resource "aws_eks_namespace" "foodfast_namespace" {
  name = "foodfast"
}

# Create a Kubernetes deployment for the application layer
resource "aws_eks_deployment" "foodfast_deployment" {
  name            = "foodfast-deployment"
  namespace        = aws_eks_namespace.foodfast_namespace.name
  cluster          = aws_eks_cluster.foodfast_cluster.name
  replicas         = 3
  revision          = "main"
  source_code_hash = "some_hash"
  strategy          = "Recreate"
}
```
This Terraform script creates a virtual private cloud (VPC) and a subnet within the VPC, and attaches an internet gateway to the VPC. It also creates a security group for the Kubernetes cluster and adds a rule to allow traffic on port 9090 for the Kubernetes cluster. Finally, it creates an EKS cluster and a namespace, and deplo

Sure, here is the continuation of the Terraform script:
```python
Create a Kubernetes deployment for the application layer
resource "awseksdeployment" "foodfastdeployment" {name = "foodfast-deployment"namespace = awseksnamespace.foodfastnamespace.namecluster = awsekscluster.foodfastcluster.namereplicas = 3revision = "main"sourcecodehash = "somehash"strategy = "Recreate"}
Create a service for the application layer
resource "awseksservice" "foodfastservice" {name = "foodfast-service"namespace = awseksnamespace.foodfastnamespace.namecluster = awsekscluster.foodfastcluster.namedeployment = awseksdeployment.foodfastdeployment.nameloadbalancertype = "nlb"securitygroups = [awssecuritygroup.foodfastk8s_sg.id]}
Create an Amazon S3 bucket for storing the static files
resource "awss3bucket" "foodfaststaticbucket" {bucket = "foodfast-static-bucket"acl = "private"region = "us-west-2"}
Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution for serving the static files
resource "awscloudfrontdistribution" "foodfastcloudfrontdist" {origindomainname = "d2455060.w5dk7cgn.h5a.1e3f.myftpupload.com"distributiondomainname = "d2455060.w5
