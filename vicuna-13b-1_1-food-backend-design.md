# Vicuna-13b v1.1 runs on a Food ordering and delivery platform (part 3)

Note: This specific part is early experimentation and should not be considered to be representative. Eg previous test indicates vicuna is capable of more sophisticated API design. At the same time, prompt still need to be carefully designed to not mislead it. Moreover, from a pragmatic point of view, since StarCode is capable at design tasks also, and it seems to run faster, future experiments may focus on that instead.

## Take 1

Sure, I'll begin with the tasks you've provided:

1. *Choose tech stack for the backend components:* For the backend components, I recommend using a microservices architecture with a combination of programming languages and frameworks. The microservices can be developed using Java and Spring Boot, with each microservice communicating with each other via REST APIs. Additionally, a database can be used to store the data, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, and a NoSQL database such as MongoDB can be used to store the delivery information.
2. *Give a high level DB schema design, suggesting the main entities and relations:* The DB schema design should be based on the Clean Architecture pattern and can include the following main entities and relations:
* Entities:
    * Food Item: This entity will store information about each food item, such as name, description, price, and availability.
    * Customer: This entity will store information about each customer, such as name, email, address, and phone number.
    * Order: This entity will store information about each order, such as the customer who placed the order, the food items in the order, the delivery address, and the payment information.
    * Delivery: This entity will store information about each delivery, such as the driver who made the delivery, the delivery time, and the delivery status.
* Relations:
    * A Food Item can be associated with many Orders, but an Order can only be associated with one Food Item.
    * A Customer can place many Orders, but an Order can only be placed by one Customer.
    * An Order can be associated with one Delivery, but a Delivery can be associated with many Orders.
3. *Give a high level API design, describing groups of endpoints and what they should do:* The API design should be based on the microservices architecture and can include the following groups of endpoints:
* Order Management Microservice:
    * POST /orders: Create a new order.
    * GET /orders/{id}: Retrieve an order by its ID.
    * PUT /orders/{id}: Update an existing order.
    * DELETE /orders/{id}: Delete an existing order.
* Delivery Management Microservice:
    * POST /deliveries: Create a new delivery.
    * GET /deliveries/{id}: Retrieve a delivery by its ID.
    * PUT /deliveries/{id}: Update an existing delivery.
    * DELETE /deliveries/{id}: Delete an existing delivery.
* Payment Management Microservice:
    * POST /payments: Create a new payment.
    * GET /payments/{id}: Retrieve a payment by its ID.
    * PUT /payments/{id}: Update an existing payment.
    * DELETE /payments/{id}: Delete an existing payment.
* Rating and Review Microservice:
    * POST /ratings: Create a new rating.
    * GET /ratings/{id}: Retrieve a rating by its ID.
    * PUT /ratings/{id}: Update an existing rating.
    * DELETE /ratings/{id}: Delete an existing rating.

Note: These are just high-level designs and can be further refined based on the specific requirements of the project.

## Take 2

### Refinement prompt

The requirement analysis phase gave these main use case:
* Customers can browse food options and place orders through the platform.
* Customers can track the delivery status of their orders in real-time.
* Customers can rate and review their experiences with the platform and provide feedback on food options and delivery service.
* The platform can generate revenue through delivery fees, commissions on food orders, and advertising.

Give a refined API design with more entities (but omit the repeating pattern of POST/GET/PUT/DELETE) and describe the sequence of interaction through these API to satisfy the use case.

### AI answer

Sure, here is a refined API design that includes additional entities and describes the sequence of interaction through these API to satisfy the use case:

Entities:
* Customer: Represents a customer who places an order or has an account on the platform.
* Order: Represents an order placed by a customer.
* FoodItem: Represents a food item available on the platform.
* Delivery: Represents a delivery of an order.
* Rating: Represents a rating given by a customer for a food item or delivery service.

Endpoints:
1. Order Management:
* /orders: Retrieve a list of recent orders placed by the customer.
* /orders/{id}: Retrieve the details of an order by its ID.
* /orders/{id}/delivery: Retrieve the details of a delivery by its ID.
* /orders/{id}/rating: Retrieve the rating of an order by its ID.
* /orders: Place a new order.
* /orders/{id}: Update an existing order.
* /orders/{id}/cancel: Cancel an existing order.
2. Delivery Management:
* /deliveries: Retrieve the list of deliveries made by the platform.
* /deliveries/{id}: Retrieve the details of a delivery by its ID.
* /deliveries/{id}/rating: Retrieve the rating of a delivery by its ID.
* /deliveries: Place a new delivery.
* /deliveries/{id}: Update an existing delivery.
* /deliveries/{id}/cancel: Cancel an existing delivery.
3. Payment Management:
* /payments: Retrieve the list of payments made by the customer.
* /payments/{id}: Retrieve the details of a payment by its ID.
* /payments/{id}/refund: Retrieve the details of a refund by its ID.
* /payments: Make a new payment.
* /payments/{id}: Update an existing payment

(network interruption)

4. Rating and Review Management:
* /ratings: Retrieve the list of ratings given by the customer.
* /ratings/{id}: Retrieve the details of a rating by its ID.
* /ratings: Place a new rating.
* /ratings/{id}: Update an existing rating.
* /ratings/{id}/delete: Delete an existing rating.
Sequence of Interaction:
1. Customer logs in to the platform and is authenticated.
2. Customer browses the food options available on the platform.
3. Customer places an order by clicking on the "Place Order" button.
4. The platform generates an order ID and sends a confirmation email to the customer.
5. The customer can track the delivery status of their order in real-time by visiting the platform and clicking on the "Track Delivery" button.
6. Once the order is delivered, the customer can rate the food item and the delivery service.
7. The customer can make a payment for their order using a secure payment gateway.
8. The platform generates revenue through delivery fees, commissions on food orders, and advertising.
9. The customer can view their order history and past ratings by visiting their account page.
Note: The above sequence of interaction is just one possible way to satisfy the use case. There may be variations based on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.

### Additional prompt

show me the code for a sequence diagram in mermaid or plantuml for the interaction above. Annotate it with url of the api endpoint involved.

### AI answer

Here's a sequence diagram in PlantUML for the interaction described above:
```
@startuml

start

customer(Client) --> |Place Order| platform(Server) : OrderPlaced
platform(Server) --> |Generate Order ID| customer(Client) : OrderID
customer(Client) --> |Track Delivery| platform(Server) : DeliveryTracked
platform(Server) --> |Update Order Status| customer(Client) : OrderStatus
customer(Client) --> |Make Payment| platform(Server) : PaymentReceived
platform(Server) --> |Update Order Status| customer(Client) : PaymentReceived
platform(Server) --> |Calculate Fees| customer(Client) : FeesCalculated
customer(Client) --> |Confirm Delivery| platform(Server) : DeliveryConfirmed
platform(Server) --> |Update Order Status| customer(Client) : DeliveryConfirmed

end

@enduml
```
In this diagram, the customer is the client who places an order and interacts with the platform which is the server. The arrows represent the flow of information between the client and the server.

Here is the URL for each API endpoint involved in the interaction:
* OrderPlaced : /orders
* OrderID : /orders/{id}
* DeliveryTracked : /orders/{id}/delivery
* OrderStatus : /orders/{id}
* PaymentReceived : /payments
* FeesCalculated : /payments/{id}
* DeliveryConfirmed : /orders/{id}

Note: The above sequence diagram is just one possible way to represent the interaction. There may be variations based on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
