# AI self-assese its potential applications


## Round 1
AI Used: Forgotten, I think it's Vicuna-13B (definitely 13B, just not sure which model)

**Human:** Scientist have recently successfully invented an Artificial General Intelligence that passed the college test across a wide spectrum of subjects. The AI interact with human through natural language texts. The AI can be adapted into any role by prompting it with instruction to role-play. Suggest some specific applications such an AI may have for a layman.

**Assistent:** An Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with the ability to pass a college test across a wide range of subjects and adapt to different roles through natural language text interactions could have numerous applications for a layman. Here are a few potential examples:

1. Personal Assistant: The AI could be used as a personal assistant to help with everyday tasks such as scheduling appointments, making reservations, and sending emails.
2. Education: The AI could be used to help teach and educate students on a variety of subjects, providing personalized learning experiences and helping to improve academic performance.
3. Customer Service: The AI could be used to provide customer service support, answering questions and resolving issues for businesses and organizations.
4. Healthcare: The AI could be used to assist with medical diagnoses, providing information and recommendations to doctors and patients.
5. Finance: The AI could be used to provide financial advice and assistance, helping individuals and businesses make informed decisions about their finances.
6. Law: The AI could be used to assist with legal research and provide legal advice.
7. Travel: The AI could be used to help plan and book travel, providing recommendations and assistance with travel arrangements.

These are just a few examples, but the potential applications for an AGI like the one you described are likely to be much broader and more diverse.

**Human:** Upon further studies, scientists also discovered that the AGI exhibit "Advanced reasoning capabilities". It is also capable of following complex instruction, and even has emergent capability such as "Few-shot learning", where the AI can acquire new skills on the spot by teaching it through the natural language interface. The AI also has ability to give structured output and can code/program. Given this info, suggest some potential application of this AI in professional domains.

**Assistent:** An Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with advanced reasoning capabilities, the ability to follow complex instructions, few-shot learning, and the ability to provide structured output and code/program could have numerous potential applications in professional domains. Here are a few examples:

1. Consulting: The AI could be used to provide expert consulting services, analyzing complex data and providing actionable insights and recommendations to businesses and organizations.
2. Financial analysis: The AI could be used to analyze financial data and provide recommendations for investments, risk management, and other financial decisions.
3. Legal assistance: The AI could be used to assist with legal research and provide recommendations for legal strategies.
4. Medical research: The AI could be used to analyze medical data and provide insights and recommendations for medical research and treatment.
5. Software development: The AI could be used to assist with software development, providing coding and programming assistance, and potentially even able to design and develop software on its own.
6. Sales and marketing: The AI could be used to analyze customer data and provide recommendations for sales and marketing strategies.
7. Research and development: The AI could be used to assist with research and development projects, providing expertise and insights across a wide range of subjects.

Again, these are just a few examples, and the potential applications for an AGI with advanced reasoning capabilities and few-shot learning are likely to be much broader and more diverse.

## Round 2
TODO (did similar test on Guanaco 33B and it give more elaborate/nuanced answers)
