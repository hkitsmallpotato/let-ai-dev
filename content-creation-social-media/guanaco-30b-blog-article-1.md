# Digital Transformation Challenges Facing Non-Tech Companies (And How Our MLOps Platform Can Help)

As more businesses realize the benefits of incorporating technology into their operations, they face significant challenges when it comes to implementing digital transformation initiatives. This is especially true for organizations outside of the tech industry that lack the expertise or resources necessary to keep up with rapid technological advancements. In this post, we will explore some of the common obstacles faced by non-tech companies during digital transformation and explain how our MLOps platform can help overcome these barriers. 

## Difficulties non-tech companies face
### Difficulty Implementing New Technologies 

One of the biggest hurdles facing non-tech companies looking to implement new technologies is the learning curve associated with adopting unfamiliar tools and processes. For example, transitioning from traditional paper-based recordkeeping systems to cloud-based software requires not only a significant investment of time but also the acquisition of new skills. Additionally, many non-tech employees may feel intimidated by the complex nature of emerging technologies and resist change due to fear of job displacement. 

### Lack of Expertise in Cutting-Edge Techniques

Another challenge faced by non-tech companies is the absence of skilled personnel who have experience using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. While there is a growing demand for workers with these skill sets, many non-tech firms struggle to attract and retain top talent due to the limited availability of such professionals and competition from larger tech companies with deeper pockets. As a result, non-tech firms often find themselves relying on outdated methods and lagging behind competitors who are able to leverage the latest technologies to gain a strategic advantage.

### Inadequate Data Governance Practices

The rise of big data has created tremendous opportunities for non-tech companies to improve operational efficiency and make better decisions. However, without proper data governance policies in place, organizations risk falling victim to data breaches, privacy violations, and other security threats. Furthermore, inconsistent data formats and quality issues can lead to poor decision making and misaligned KPIs. Establishing effective data management practices can be particularly difficult for non-tech firms that do not have dedicated teams responsible for overseeing data collection and storage.

### Integration Issues with Legacy Systems 

Non-tech companies frequently rely on legacy IT infrastructure that was designed before the advent of modern computing platforms. Attempting to integrate new technologies with antiquated systems can be a daunting task, requiring substantial amounts of time and resources. Moreover, older hardware and software may be less secure than contemporary solutions, posing additional risks to organizational assets and sensitive information. Upgrading existing systems can be costly and disruptive, which may deter non-tech firms from embracing digital transformation.

- Automated Workflows - Automation is at the heart of our MLops platform, allowing us to streamline the development process and reduce human error. From code testing and version control to release management and monitoring, we use automated workflows to optimize every stage of the software lifecycle, resulting in faster time to market and improved overall productivity. 
- Reliable Security Protocols - Cybersecurity is critical for any organization, particularly those operating in highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare. At [Company Name], we understand the importance of protecting sensitive information and adhering to industry standards. That’s why we take a proactive approach to security, implementing rigorous protocols to keep our clients’ data safe. Some of the security measures we implement include:
  - Strict physical security controls in place to protect our facilities against intrusion and unauthorized access. This includes 24/7 video surveillance, biometric scanners, and controlled entry points.
  - Regular penetration tests and vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses and take corrective action.
  - We leverage encryption both at rest (data stored within databases) and in transit (over networks). We do not store passwords in plaintext; instead, they’re hashed using strong algorithms. Communications between servers and users occur via secure connections (TLS), and all data in transit is encrypted.
  - We work with only the most reputable and trustworthy vendors to host our solutions. All of our services are hosted in certified data centers that meet stringent security standards. For organizations that require even tighter control over their IT infrastructure, we can also deploy our solutions on premises.
