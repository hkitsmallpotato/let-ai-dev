## Kubernetes autoscaling based on promethus metric

### Prompt

Show me the kubernetes yaml files for a deployment with autoscaling based on an external metric that can be accessed via an api call, and Secret injected through k8s secret, as env variable. Please try to keep your yaml short and omit fields that are not strictly necessary.

### AI answer

Here is an example of Kubernetes YAML file for deploying an application with Autoscaling based on an External Metric:
1. First we need to create a Service Account which will be used by our Deployment/Pod :
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: myapp-serviceaccount
---
```

Copy

2. Then we need to define a Role and RoleBinding that grants permissions to access the metrics API using the service account created in step 1:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: myapp-externalmetrics-reader
rules:
- nonResourceURLs: ["/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/*"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-myapp-externalmetricss
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: myapp-externalmetrics-reader
  apiGroup: ""
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: myapp-serviceaccount
  namespace: default
---
```

Copy

3. Now let’s create a new Custom Resource Definition (CRD) called MyAppAutoscaler that defines the desired behavior of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler when it scales up or down replicas. In this case, we want to scale our app based on the value returned from the custom query defined in the spec field below:
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  # Name must match the spec fields below, and be in the form:<plural>.<group>
  name: myapps.example.com
spec:
  group: example.com
  version: v1alpha1
  names:
    plural: myapps
    singular: myapp
    kind: MyApp
    listKind: MyAppList
  scope: Namespaced
---
```
Copy

4. Next, we’ll create a sample instance of the CRD above named myautoscale:
```yaml
apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
kind: MyAppAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: myautoscale
spec:
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 70
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  serviceName: myappsvc
  path: /api/v1/query_range
  scheme: http
  interval: 60s
  successThreshold: 1
  failureThreshold: 3
  timeoutSeconds: 10
  queryParams:
    query: sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod=~"nginx.*"}[5m])) BY (namespace)
    start: <start time>
    end: <end time>
    step: 1m
```
Copy

5. The next step would be creating a ConfigMap containing the authentication details required to connect to the Prometheus server where the metrics data resides. Here I am assuming you have already deployed a Prometheus Server into your Kubenetes cluster and exposed its API endpoint via NodePort type services. You may also choose to use other means such as ingress controllers etc.:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  prometheus.yml: |+
    global:
      scrape_interval:     15s
      evaluation_interval: 15s

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'prometheus'
       static_configs:
        - targets: ['localhost:9090']

     - job_name: 'kubernetes-nodes'
       tls_config:
         ca_file: '/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt'
       bearer_token_file: '/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token'
       kubernetes_sd_configs:
         - role: node
       relabel_configs:
         - action: labelmap
           regex: __meta_kubernetes_node_label_(.+)
         - target_label: __address__
           replacement: kubernetes.default.svc:443
         - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_node_name]
           regex: (.+)
           target_label: __metrics_path__
           replacement: /api/v1/nodes/${1}/proxy/metrics
```

## Kubernetes secret injection

### Prompt

Show me the kubernetes yaml files for a deployment with secret injected through k8s secret, as env variable. Please try to keep your yaml short and omit fields that are not strictly necessary.

### AI answer

Here is an example of Kubernetes YAML file defining a Deployment resource which injects a Secret into its Pods via environment variables:

1. Define a Secret containing the database connection details in a separate YAML file (e.g., secrets.yaml):
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-app-db-credentials
type: Opaque
data:
  DB_HOST: <base64 encoded value>
  DB_USER: <base64 encoded value>
  DB_PASSWORD: <<PASSWORD>>
```
Copy
Copy
2. In the main YAML file (e.g., deployments.yaml), define a Deployment object referencing this Secret using a volume mount and environment variables:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: myrepo/myimage:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
          envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: my-app-db-credentials
          volumeMounts:
            - name: db-credentials
              mountPath: /etc/secrets/db-credentials
              readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: db-credentials
          secret:
            secretName: my-app-db-credentials
```
Copy
Copy

In this example, we have mounted the entire contents of the my-app-db-credentials Secret under /etc/secrets/db-credentials, where each key from the original Secret becomes a file within the directory. We can then reference these values directly by their filename without having to specify them individually in the env: section. Note also how we’ve specified the readOnly: true flag on our Volume Mount so that any changes made inside the running Container will be discarded once it exits.

## Traefik CRD IngressRoute task

### Prompt

Show me the code to expose some k8s service through Traefik using CRD IngressRoute. The map is:
- domain "example.com"
  - / - goes to service frontend
  - /api - goes to service backend
- domain "download.example.com" - goes to service s3

### AI answer

Here’s an example of how you can use a custom resource definition (CRD) called IngressRoute in Kubernetes to route traffic for two domains, example.com and download.example.com, to different services within your cluster:

1. First create three deployments that will serve as our frontends (frontend) and backends (backend). You could also deploy other types of applications like databases or caches here if needed.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: nginx
          name: webserver

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: httpd
          name: server

---

#... additional Deployments omitted for brevity
```

2. Next we need to define Services for each deployment so they are accessible from outside the cluster. We’ll call these services frontend-svc and backend-svc.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend-svc
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: frontend

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend-svc
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 80
      nodePort: 30080
      targetPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: backend

---

#... additional Services omitted for brevity
```

3. Now let’s configure Traefik by creating a ConfigMap with its configuration file. This step assumes you have already installed Traefik into your cluster following official documentation. If not please refer to https://doc.traefik.io/.
Create a new configmap named traefik-config containing this YAML snippet:

```yaml
entryPoints:
  websecure:
    address: :443
  web:
    address: :80
  
api: {}

providers:
  kubernetescrd: {}
```

4. Finally, lets create the actual ingress routes using the previously created resources. For simplicity sake I am going to assume both subdomains point directly at my NGINX instance running on localhost but it should be straightforward to modify according to your specific needs.

Note that since we’re working with Custom Resource Definitions there isn’t any special syntax required aside from defining objects based on their API version and Kind.
Here’s what the final yaml would look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: example-route
spec:
  entrypoints: 
    - websecure
  routes:
    - match: Host(`example.com`) && PathPrefix(`/`)
      kind: Rule
      services: 
        - name: frontend-svc
          namespace: default
          scheme: h2c

    - match: Host(`example.com`) && PathPrefix(`/api`)
      kind: Rule
      services: 
        - name: backend-svc
          namespace: default
          passHostHeader: true
          responseForwarding:
            forwardResponseHeaders:
              - X-Custom-Header
              - Content-Length
          stickySession: 
            cookie: 
              secure: false
              samesite: lax
              path: "/"
              httponly: true
              expiry: 6h

---

apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: download-route
spec:
  entrypoints: 
    - websecure
  routes:
    - match: Host(`download.example.com`) 
      kind: Rule
      services: 
        - name: s3-service
          namespace: default
          loadBalancer:
            servers:
              - url: "http://localhost:9000/"
```

5. Apply all those manifest files to your cluster via kubectl apply command. Afterwards you should see corresponding ingresses being created automatically. To test them out open up browser tabs pointed at https://example.com/ and https://download.example.com/ respectively. You may notice that only requests under /api path get routed correctly while rest still return 404 Not Found error because no such endpoints exist in the provided sample application configurations.


## Baremetal k8s HTTP cert integration task

## Prompt

**Initial**:

Show me how to automatically provision http certificates for services to be exposed publicly in kubernetes cluster and to install those certificate in the ingress automatically. List any command and files needed but omit command’s output.

**Later**:

Show me how to automatically provision http certificates for services to be exposed publicly in kubernetes cluster and to install those certificate in the ingress automatically. List any command and files needed but omit command’s output. We also have already installed cert-manager and applied the issuer resource, so please continue from there.

## AI answer

To automatically provision HTTP certificates for services that you want to expose publicly in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use cert-manager. Here are the steps:
1. Install cert-manager using Helm:
```
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io && \
helm repo update && \
kubectl create namespace cert-manager && \
helm upgrade --install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --version v0.16.1 --set installCRDs=true
```
2. Create an Issuer resource file (e.g., issuer.yaml) with your desired configuration options for issuing TLS certificates. For example, if you’re using Let’s Encrypt as your CA, this might look something like:
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
  spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: <your_email>
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    solvers:
    - dns01:
        route53:
          region: eu-central-1
          accessKeyID: <access_key_id>
          secretAccessKeySecretRef:
            name: aws-secret
            key: secret_access_key
```
Replace <your_email> with your actual email address, and replace <access_key_id> and secret_access_key with your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key respectively.
3. Apply the Issuer resource:
```
kubectl apply -f issuer.yaml
```
4. Add the JetStack repository to Helm:
```
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
```
5. Update your local Helm chart repositories:
```
helm repo update
```
6. Use Helm to deploy nginx-ingress with support for automatic HTTPS certificates from LetsEncrypt by including the following values when deploying it via Helm or directly applying YAML manifests:
```yaml
controller:
  extraArgs:
    default-ssl-certificate: "kube-system/<my-tls-certificate>" # Replace my-tls-certificate with the name of your Ingress TLS Certificate
rbac:
  create: true
  
 serviceAccount:
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: ar
```

show me the remaining part of the file in step 6 above and continue with the rest of the steps.

(Network interrupted)

To automatically provision HTTP certificates for services that you want to expose publicly in a Kubernetes cluster and install them on your Ingress resources, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an Issuer custom resource (CR) file: The first step is to create an Issuer CR YAML file that specifies the details of the CA or certificate authority (CA) that will issue the TLS/SSL certificate. You need to provide this information such as the name of the CA, its URL, and credentials if necessary. Here’s an example of what the Issuer CR might look like:
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: <your_email>
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    solvers:
    - dns01:
        route53:
          region: eu-central-1
          accessKeyID: <access_key_id>
          secretAccessKeySecretRef:
            name: aws-secret
            key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
Copy
Copy
2. Apply the Issuer CR: Once you’ve created the Issuer CR YAML file, apply it using kubectl by running the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml
```
Copy

Copy
3. Add annotations to your service(s): To enable automatic provisioning of HTTPS certificates for your services, add the following annotation to each Service object that needs a certificate: cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod". For example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myservice
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: MyApp
  annotations:
    # Add this line below to enable HTTPS
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
   - protocol: TCP
     port: 80
     targetPort: 9376
```
Copy

4. Deploy Cert Manager: If you haven’t deployed Cert Manager yet, do so now by applying the latest version manifest available at their GitHub repository. This should deploy all required components including the Certificate controller and webhook component which handle issuing certificates.
5. Wait until the ACME account has been registered with your DNS provider: Before requesting certificates, make sure that the ACME account associated with your Issuer has been successfully registered with your DNS provider. Depending on the DNS provider, this may require adding TXT records to your domain zone file. Check the status of your registration by checking the ‘Ready’ field in your Issuer resource.
6. Requesting Certificates: Now that everything is set up correctly, you’re ready to request certificates! Simply add the desired hostname(s) under spec.commonName in one or more Certificate objects. For example:
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: mydomain-tls
spec:
  commonName: mydomain.com
  dnsNames:
  - www.mydomain.com
  issuerRef:
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    name: letsencrypt-prod
  secretName: mydomain-tls-secret
```
Copy

7. Verifying Your SSL Certificate: After creating your Certificate resource, wait some time before the certificate becomes valid (~1 minute). Then verify that your SSL certificate was properly issued by checking whether the Secret containing your certificate contains two keys named tls.crt and tls.key. Additionally, check that the certificate is trusted by opening it in a web browser or using OpenSSL:
`openssl s_client -showcerts -connect mydomain.com:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null| openssl x509 -text | less`

Copy

8. Configuring Nginx Ingress Controller: Finally, configure your Nginx Ingress Controller to use the certificate stored in the specified Secret by setting the ssl-certificate and ssl-certificate-key directives in the appropriate location block within your nginx configuration file. Make sure to restart the Nginx pod after making changes to the configmap.

Note: It’s important to note that while these instructions cover configuring Let’s Encrypt as the CA, other CAs like ZeroSSL are supported too. Just replace references to Let’s Encrypt with the relevant fields for whichever CA you choose to use instead.

If I use Traefik as ingress instead, how do I let Traefik use the certificates resources at the entrypoint?

To have traefik automatically pick up cert-manager generated secrets follow this guide https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#example-usage-of-the-kubernetes-ingressroute-with-a-tls-challenge. This will allow traefik to request new certs from lets encrypt when needed without any manual intervention required on your part.

## Openstack Magnum deploy k8s cluster task

### Prompt

Show me the command to deploy a kubernetes cluster in openstack magnum using the openstack command line client.

### AI Answer

Here is an example of how you can use the OpenStack CLI (openstack) and Magnum API to create a Kubernetes Cluster:

1. Install the python-magnumclient package if it’s not already installed on your system. You may need root access or sudo privileges for this step, depending on your environment.
```
pip install --upgrade python-magnumclient
```
Copy

Copy
2. Authenticate against your OpenStack cloud by running the following commands. Replace <auth_url>, and with appropriate values.
```
export OS_AUTH_URL=<auth_url>
export OS_USERNAME=<username>
export OS_PASSWORD=<password>
export OS_PROJECT_NAME=<project name>  # Optional
export OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID=default   # Optional
export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID=default # Optional
source /root/keystonerc_admin      # Assuming keystone credentials are stored here as admin creds
```
Copy
Copy
3. Create a heat stack template file that defines the desired configuration of your Kubernetes cluster. Here we will be creating a simple three node cluster with one master and two worker nodes. The template should look something like this:
```yaml
heat_template_version: ocata
resources:
  k8s_cluster:
    type: OS::Magnum::Cluster
    properties:
      api_address: 'https://<api_endpoint>:6443'
      cluster_template_id: c97c5f0b-e9a9-4d5b-baec-9eb0acddd9fc
     coe: kubernetes
      container_network_cidr: 10.244.0.0/16
      docker_volume_size: 10
      flavor: m1.large
      master_count: 1
      network_driver: flannel
      node_count: 2
      pod_vswitch_ids:
        - d8deea2c-fcb5-49bc-bdfe-dcae7ccfaae6
      server_type: vm
      volume_driver: cinder
      labels:
         foo: bar

  k8s_pool:
     type: OS::Heat::AutoScalingGroup
     depends_on: k8s_cluster
     properties:
       min_size: {get_param: [k8s_cluster, node_count]}
       max_size: {get_param: [k
```
Copy

Copy
please continue.
Sure, here’s the next part of the template:
```yaml
  k8s_nodes:</code>
    <ul>
      {% for node in range(0, properties['node_count']) %}
        <li>{{ resource_name }}{{ '-' ~ loop.index }}</li>
      {% endfor %}</ul>
```

Copy

Copy
what is the next step?

The next step would be to create a stack using this updated heat template and provide values for all parameters that were marked as required by the template (in red). You can then use OpenStack Heat CLI or API to launch your Kubernetes cluster on top of existing infrastructure resources provisioned with other tools like Nova/Neutron etc., if you have already created those resources beforehand via some other means outside of heat templates.

Show me the command used for the previous step you described.

## Ansible install elasticsearch cluster task

(The first answer is perfect, but my fat finger swiped chrome to last page so it was lost, and subsequenet answer is worse somehow (Somehow it didn't cache despite me entering what I think is the exact phrase, it does cache to my frustration in other situation... Murphy's law?))

TODO

Show me the source for an ansible script to deploy an elasticsearch cluster to VMs.

----

Here is a sample Ansible playbook that can be used to deploy Elasticsearch clusters:

```
- name: Configure hosts file template: src=hosts.j2 dest=/etc/ansible/hosts tags: [elasticsearch]
Create data and log directories on all nodes
- name: Ensure data directory exists file: path={{ es_data_dir }} state=directory owner=elasticsearch group=elasticsearch mode=0755 with_items: groups[‘all’] when: inventory_hostname in groups[es_groupname] tags: [elasticsearch, dirs]
- name: Ensure log directory exists file: path={{ item }}/logs state=directory owner=elasticsearch group=elasticsearch mode=0755 loop: “{{groups[‘all’]}}” when: inventory_hostname in groups[es_groupname] tags: [elasticsearch, logs]
Install Java 8 (OpenJDK)
- apt: pkg=“{{item}}” update_cache=yes cache_valid_time=3600 become: true with_items:
    * openjdk-8-jre-headless
    * ca-certificates-java tags: [packages, java]
Download Elasticsearch from official repository

Extract downloaded archive into /opt folder
- unarchive: copy=no src=“/tmp/{{ es_filename }}” dest=/opt creates=/opt/elasticsearch-{{ es_version }} notify: restart elasticsearch tags: [install, elasticsearch]
Set up configuration files
- name: Copy configuration files template: src={{ item }}.j2 dest=/opt/elasticsearch-{{ es_version }}/config/{{ item }} owner=root group=elasticsearch mode=0644 with_items: - elasticsearch.yml - jvm.options notify: restart elasticsearch tags: [configure, elasticsearch]
Start service at boot time
- systemd: daemon_reload=true enabled=yes name=elasticsearch become: yes tags: [service, elasticsearch]
handlers:
Restart Elasticsearch
- name: restart elasticsearch systemd: name=elasticsearch state=restarted
Wait for Elasticsearch to start
- name: wait for elasticsearch uri: url: http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?wait_for_status=yellow&timeout=120s status_code: 200 return_content: no body_format: json register: result until: result.json.status == “yellow” or result.json.status == “green” retries: 10 delay: 10
Check if Elasticsearch has started successfully
- name: check if elasticsearch is running command: curl --silent --fail localhost:9200 ignore_errors: True failed_when: False register: response
Fail task if Elasticsearch fails to start within timeout period
- fail: msg=‘Elasticsearch did not start after {{ retry * 10 + delay }} seconds’ when: > (‘Failed connect to localhost port 9200:’ in response.stderr or ‘Connection refused’ in response.stderr) and retry < 10 vars: retry: “{{loop.index}}”
Run health checks every minute
- cron: name=“Run Elasticsearch Health Checks” hour=“" minute="/1” job=“/usr/bin/systemctl reload-or-restart elasticsearch.service”
```
This playbook will install OpenJDK 8 using APT package manager, download Elasticsearch distribution tarball from Elastic website, extract it under /opt directory, set up necessary configuration files such as jvm.options, elasticsearch.yml. It also sets up Elasticsearch as a system service so that you can easily manage its lifecycle through standard Linux commands like start,stop, etc. Finally this playbook runs periodic healthchecks of your Elasticsearch cluster by hitting _cluster/health endpoint of each node regularly.

----
Show me the ansible script to install an elasticsearch cluster on VMs with 1 master and 2 slaves. It should uses elasticsearch's apt repo to install, should generate a minimal elasticsearch config file inline in the ansible script, and then proceed to create index, and wire up logstash and kibana.

----

Here is an example of how you could use Ansible playbooks to deploy Elasticsearch:
1- Install Java using APT package manager (on all nodes):
```
    - name: Add repository key
      apt_key:
        url: https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch

    - name: Add repository
      apt_repository:
        repo: deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/{{ es_version }}/apt stable main

    - name: Update cache and install java
      apt: 
        update_cache=yes  
        pkg={{ item }} 
      loop: [ 'openjdk-8-jdk', 'ca-certificates' ]
```

2- Create data directories for each node (/var/lib/elasticsearch) :
```
   - name: Ensure that the required directory exists
      file:
        path=/var/lib/elasticsearch
        state=directory
        owner=elasticsearch
        group=elasticsearch
        mode=0755

    # Copy configuration files from templates 
    - name: Configure ES 
      template: 
        src=templates/elasticsearch.yml.j2
        dest=/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

    - name: Configure Log4J
      copy:
        src=files/log4j2.properties
        dest=/etc/elasticsearch/log4j2.properties

 ...
  # Start services 
  - systemd:
    daemon_reload: yes
    enabled: true
    masked: no
    name: "{{item}}"
  loop: ["elasticsearch"]
```
Copy
Copy

3- Deploy Kibana and configure it as reverse proxy to access your ElasticSearch instance via Nginx web server:
```
# Download & Extract Kibana archive into /opt folder
- unarchive:
    remote_src: True
    src: "https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-{{ kibana_version }}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz"
    dest: "/opt/"
    creates: "/opt/kibana-{{ kibana_version }}"

...

# Set up nginx virtual host
- name: Configure NGINX Virtual Host 
  template:
    src: templates/nginx_vhost.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

  notify: restart nginx

# Restart Nginx service
- systemd:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
```

4- Setup Logstash to collect logs and ship them to Elasticsearch:
```
# Download & Extract Logstash tarball into /opt folder
- unarchive:
    remote_src: True
    src: "https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/logstash/logstash-{{ logstash_version }}.tar.gz"
    dest: "/opt/"
    creates: "/opt/logstash-{{ logstash_version }}"

...

# Configure input plugin(s)
- lineinfile:
    path: /path/to/your/pipeline/config
    regexp: "^.*input {.*$"
    line: "    beats {"

- lineinfile:
    path: /path/to/your/pipeline/config
    insertafter: "^.*input {.*$"
    line: "        port => {{ beat_port | default('5044') }}"

# Configure filter plugins if any

# Configure output plugin(s)
- lineinfile:
    path: /path/to/your/pipeline/config
    insertbefore: "^.*output {.*$"
    line: "    elasticsearch {"

- lineinfile:
    path: /path/to/your/pipeline/config
    insertafter: "^.*output {.*$"
    line: "        hosts => ['localhost']"

# Start Logstash pipeline
- shell: >
    bin/logstash --modules netflow \
                  --setup \
                  --pipelines.file /path/to/your/pipeline/config
```

5- Finally setup cron job or launchd task to periodically check for new security advisories published by NVD (National Vulnerability Database), e.g.:`
#!/bin/sh
curl http://static.nvd.nist.gov/feeds/xml/cve/misc/nvdcve-2.0-<YEAR>.xml.zip >> ~/Downloads/cves.xml.zip && unzip cves.xml.zip && rm cves.xml.zip && grep "<entry>" nvdcve-2.0*.xml | cut -f9 -d">"|cut -f1 -d"<"|sort|uniq -c|awk '{print $2","$1}' > nvd_counts.csv`

## ELK config file task

### Prompt

Show me an example logstash config to collect logs from kubernetes cluster's pod. It should consolidate then send to an elasticsearch cluster. Also show curl commands to create index etc if necessary.

### AI answer

Here is a sample Logstash configuration file that can be used to collect Kubernetes Pod logs and store them in an Elasticsearch cluster:

1. Create the Elasticsearch index for storing the logs:
```
curl -XPUT 'http://<elasticsearch-url>:9200/kubernetes_logs' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
    "mappings": {
        "@timestamp": {
            "type":   "date"
        }
    }
}'
```

Copy

2. Save the following content as logstash.conf and place it under /etc/logstash/ on your Logstash instance or container (replace <your-es-endpoint> with your actual endpoint):
```
input {
  kubernetes {
    # Replace this URL with the one provided by your Kubernetes API server
    url => "https://<kubernetes-apiserver-host>:<port>/api/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/pods?fieldSelector=status.phase%3DRunning&watch=true"

    # Configure how frequently to poll for new updates, in seconds
    interval => 60
    
    # Optional SSL settings
    ssl_certificate_authority => "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt"
    verify_ssl => true

    # Optionally configure any additional fields you want to add to each event record
    metadata_whitelist => ["annotations.*"]
  }
}
filter {
  mutate {
     remove_field => [ "[log][offset]" ]
   }

  date {
      match => [ "time", "ISO8601" ]
  }
  
  grok {
       patterns_dir => ["/usr/share/logstash/patterns"]
       pattern => "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:time}%{SPACE}%{LOGLEVEL:level}%{SPACE}\[%{DATA:thread}]%{SPACE}(\-%{NUMBER:pid})?\ %{GREEDYDATA:class}: %{GREEDYMULTILINE:message}"
  }
}
output {
  elasticsearch { 
    hosts => "<your-es-endpoint>"
    manage_template => false
    template => "/dev/null"
    document_id => "%{[@metadata][uid]}"
    codec => rubydebug 
  }
}
```
Copy

3. Restart Logstash so that it picks up the changes made to its configuration files. You may need to restart both the Logstash service and the Filebeat daemonset depending on which version of Kubernetes you are using.
4. Verify that events are being indexed into Elasticsearch: Once Logstash has started processing incoming data, you can use Kibana to view the ingested documents in the kubernetes_logsindex. To do this, open Kibana and navigate to Discover > Add Data. In the Search bar, type @timestamp: followed by the time range you wish to search (e.g., @timestamp:[now-1h TO now]). This will allow you to see all events within the specified time frame.
Note: If you receive errors such as “unknown setting [doc_as_upsert]” when running these steps, make sure you have updated your Logstash image to at least v7.5.2. These issues were fixed in later versions.
