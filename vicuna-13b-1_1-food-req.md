# Vicuna-13b v1.1 runs on a Food ordering and delivery platform (part 1)

Note: Smarter LLM models (those with higher param count) seems to have a tendency to be able to predict user conversation ahead of time better, so they are more likely to cross the "confidence threshold" faster and rush ahead to write the documents, instead of patiently talking with users to clarify requirements.

As far as my memory goes, it crossed that threshold either with nothing at all, or with just user's beginning line (that describe the product wanted in one single short phrase) immediately. Therefore no user conversation is shown here because there is none.
